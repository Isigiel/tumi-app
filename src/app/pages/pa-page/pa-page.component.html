          You want to start the exchange on a high note, get to know other students from all around the world and have

          <p>
            You’ll be assigned to a group of 20 exchange students and 5 tutors. With this group of 25 amazing people,
            you’ll spend your first two weeks exploring Munich. The program might be for two weeks, but you’ll remain
            friends for life.

          <p>
            Let's not kid ourselves, the best way to make new friends is to have one, or two, or more beers together. At
            party animals we wil make sure that you're very familiar with bavarian beer culture after two weeks.

            <br/>To kick everything off we will spend a night at Wernfels Castle. Yes, you read it right a 13th century
            castle next to Nuremberg. While on other days in Munich we have other things coming up: a brewery tour, the
